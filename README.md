# **BIPED BOT**

### Description
___
> Welcome to the Bipedal Bot Project! This project focuses on the development of a bipedal robot that mimics human-like locomotion and explores the realm of robotics.

### Introduction
___
This Project is about creating a robot that walks on two legs, similar to how humans walk. We're exploring how robots can walk smoothly and adapt to different surfaces using technology like learning algorithms and smart control systems.

### Assembling
___
For those without access to a 3D printer, several online services offer affordable options for printing the necessary components and you can find the stl files in this     [website](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Controlled-Robotic-Biped/). 

Finally the bot should look similar to this picture.
We have designed a PCB to power all the servo motors as to look neat and clean.

#### Pin Connection
___
| Servo | Arduino Pin |
| --- | ----------- |
| Right hip | 11 |
| Right Knee | 10 |
| Right foot | 9 |
| Left hip | 6 |
| Left knee | 5 |
| Left foot | 3 |

### Installation and Upload
___
- Install Arduino IDE from this [website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Calibrate the servo motor and keep the neutral angle as 90 degree.
- Upload the given program
